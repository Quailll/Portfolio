# Portfolio
Portfolio to document all my past work.
## Description

- My motivation for creating my portfolio was to have something that I could look back on and show all my past work.   
- I built this project so that I could have an easy way to show off my work and show different ways of contacting me.
- This program gives me the ability to put all my projects in one area in an organized way. 
- I learned that having organized and readable code will help significantly with your coding and that having a managed portfolio can help with future job opportunities.  

## Images

- [alt text](/assets/images/IMG.png) I don't really have good pictures of me and this was the best one.
- [alt text](/assets/images/img1.png) This is just a placeholder image until I have a better image to put there.
- [alt text](/assets/images/screenshot1.png)[alt text](/assets/images/Screenshot2.png) These are both screenshots of the HTML and CSS.
- [alt text](/assets/images/screenshot3.png) Just showing about me on page.
- [alt text](/assets/images/screenshot4.png) Where my projects will go and contact info. The body didn't come out the way I wanted it to, but I will keep on working on it in the future and make it look better.
