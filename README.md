# Portfolio
Portfolio to document all my past work.
## Description

- My motivation for creating my portfolio was to have something that I could look back on and show all my past work.   
- I built this project so that I could have an easy way to show off my work and show different ways of contacting me.
- This program gives me the ability to put all my projects in one area in an organized way. 
- I learned that having organized and readable code will help significantly with your coding and that having a managed portfolio can help with future job opportunities.
